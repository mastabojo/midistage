Setting the Pitch Bend Range for Individual Programs via MIDI
-------------------------------------------------------------
http://kurzweil.com/knowledgebase/me-1/midi_controllers/33/

Pitch Bend Range can be set by sending MIDI controller messages. Specifically, you do it with Registered Parameters (cc# 100 and 101).

On the MIDI channel in question, you need to send:
MIDI cc101 	= 0
MIDI cc100 	= 0
MIDI cc6 	= value of desired bend range (in semitones)

Example: Lets say you want to set the bend range to 2 semi-tones. First you send cc# 100 with a value of 0; then cc#101 with a value of 0. This turns on reception for setting pitch bend with the Data controller (#6). Then you send cc# 6 with a value of 2 (in semitones; this will give you a whole step up and a whole step down from the center).

Once you have set the bend range the way you want, then you send controller 100 or 101 with a value of 127 so that any further messages of controller 6 (which you might be using for other stuff) won't change the bend range. 

Select Programs via MIDI

1. by default, the KME/61 and ME-1 use MIDI Bank message cc#32 (Bank LSB**) to send/receive bank info
2. following the bank message a standard program change needs to be sent (0-127) depending on the patch in that bank you are after

The KME/ME has 2 Banks (see pg. 11 in the manual):
-MIDI Bank 0
-MIDI Bank 6

An example:
You want to call up program 099 "Electric 12" (from bank 6)

From your keyboard/DAW, on the desired channel, you send :
-cc32=6
-pchg=99

Repeat for other channels as needed (up to 16).

**If your keyboard/DAW also forces you to send cc#0 (Bank MSB) simply enter value=0 (zero).

Effects
-------
You can also select an effect by sending the
MicroPiano a MIDI controller 83 message with one
of the values shown in the above chart. Note that
any value greater than 16 selects ÒPrgÓ mode

The Wet/Dry Mix of reverb can be adjusted
from your master controller by sending MIDI con-
troller 91 messages. Values 0-127 change the mix
from dry to wet.

The Wet/Dry Mix of chorus can be adjusted
from your master controller by sending MIDI con-
troller 93 messages. Values 0-127 change the mix
from dry to wet.

When you change the EFFECTS mode (either
through the front panel or through MIDI), the
Wet/Dry Mix is reset to the new effectÕs default.
Similarly, when you change the PROGRAM mode
while the EFFECTS mode is set to ÒPrg,Ó the
Wet/Dry Mix is reset to the new effectÕs defau
